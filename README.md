# App title 

## Purpose
This app is designed to support Anime lovers with tracking when thier faviourite shows are being released so they never miss an ep. 

This will allow users to look through mulitple platforms of shows and filter through each to see what they would like to watch depending on the platform they have a asubscription to. 

This centralises this decision, so people do not have to search through each platform individually for what to watch. 

## Functionality / features
This application pulls data on shows from an API which details all the shows and their upcoming release days and lets the user add these to thier watchlist, which will then present a calander for the user to schedule to watch this episode. 

If a shows airdate is finished it will drop off their calander but still be available to search and see the rating & reviews of the show.  

Users will be able to have a single sign up option through Google.

## Project Management

#### To start our project we first set up standard ruberic requirements in Trello and started basic admin work e.g Github Repo before we brainstormed on some key concepts or interests of both people to determine a product.

#### After this we spent half a day whiteboarding wireframes and concepts for a minimum viable product and started basic wireframes. Wireframes were done together so everyone understood the final product and agreed on outcomes.
